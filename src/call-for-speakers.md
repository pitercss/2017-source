# Call for speakers

## Conference

Full-day, single track, English-speaking front-end conference in St. Petersburg, Russia on June 16th, 2017. The very first Russian front-end conference fully dedicated to visual front-end technologies. If you don’t speak Russian it’s the first time when you’re truly welcome: English is our main language for talks, discussions, and all information. We’re trying to unite Russian and worldwide communities. And all this in the most beautiful and the most European city in Russia during the famous white nights season.

## Topics

We want to discuss the whole set of visual front-end technologies:

- Styling: from CSS to CSS-in-JS alternatives.
- Graphics: from SVG to WebGL or even GIF.
- Typography: from fonts loading to kerning nuances.
- Accessibility: from ARIA to contrast and readability.
- Semantics: from HTML to Schema.
- Tooling: from pre-processors to style guides.
- Methods: from BEM to Functional CSS.
- Future standards, education, experiments, fun, etc.

You’re welcome to submit multiple talks or even raw ideas.

## Guidelines

To have more chances to get accepted your talk should meet following criteria:

- Language: all talks are in English, with no exception.
- Duration: you’ll have 30 minutes and optional 10 minutes for QA.
- Quality: visual fidelity, great typography, perfect styling, and good contrast.
- Originality: we prefer premieres and unique topics to anything you’ve already presented elsewhere or anything well-known among developers.
- Brevity: give it a catchy name and try to describe the main plot in a couple of paragraphs instead of writing the whole text. Two main questions to answer: why this topic and why do you want to talk about it.

## We can help

If you’re not a native speaker we could help you to rehearse and proofread your talk, but intermediate English level is required
